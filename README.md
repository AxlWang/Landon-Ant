# Landon-Ant
EN: You can use the attached code to observe the running effect of Langton Ants in Excel VBA.
It's the first time I programmed it in VBA. The idea was to establish a loop, update the position of the ant in the current loop, and then set a time function to delay the execution of the next loop, hoping to achieve animation effects. The programming process is very simple. Although the result of running is that the animation effect can be achieved, it is not smooth enough and the speed will be very slow. If you press the "Esc" button, you will be surprised to find that the program runs faster until the end condition is met before stopping.

CN: 您可以使用附件的代码在Excel VBA中观察兰顿蚂蚁的运行效果。我第一次在VBA中编写这样的程序，思路是建立循环，在当前循环中更新蚂蚁的位置，然后设置时间函数延迟执行下一次循环，希望以此达到动画的效果。编程过程很简单。虽然运行的结果是可以达到动画效果，但是不够流畅，速度会很慢，如果按下Esc键，你会惊奇发现程序运行加快，直到满足结束条件才停止。
